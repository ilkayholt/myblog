I work at the British Library as a Scholarly Communication Lead. My job is to contribute to the on-going development of, and lead on the implementation of a scholarly communications strategy in the library including translating the strategy into action plans and practices and engaging with the global scholarly communication community on behalf of the library. I also carried out a community engagement role at the Library, in the Advancing Hyku, a repository technology development project, funded by Arcadia from August 2020 to February 2022.
